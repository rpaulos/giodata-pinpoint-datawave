<h2 id="project-overview">🧠 Project Overview</h2>

<!-- PinPoint Overview Image -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LZv4EsL.png" alt="PinPoint Overview" width="100%"/>
</p>

<!-- Project Description -->
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  <strong>PinPoint</strong> is an AI-powered branch planning tool developed to support BPI in identifying strategic and sustainable locations for new branches. The current site selection process is highly manual and prone to inefficiencies, requiring extensive data gathering on demographics, economic, and competitor presence. These challenges often result in misallocated resources, underutilized branches, and uncertainty in branch performance.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  The solution leverages advanced network science and generative AI to automate and enhance decision-making. By allowing users to pin potential sites on an interactive map, PinPoint evaluates key factors such as population demographics, purchasing power, nearby business activity, crime rates, and hazard risks. The system then synthesizes these inputs into clear, evidence-based recommendations, ensuring greater accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in branch planning.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  PinPoint primarily serves BPI’s branch planners, marketing teams, and decision-makers by streamlining the evaluation process and improving market analysis. Indirectly, customers also benefit through enhanced accessibility and branch availability in areas that better meet their needs. In doing so, PinPoint enables BPI to optimize its branch network, strengthen community reach, and pursue growth with confidence.

## Data Sources and Methodology

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  This section highlights the coverage of PinPoint, focusing on the Luzon island group while also incorporating international data relevant to Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). The platform consolidates key information such as branch locations, services, and accessibility, ensuring that BPI teams have a clear and organized view of essential banking resources. This helps staff make informed decisions and provide better support to clients both locally and abroad.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
PinPoint’s accuracy and reliability depend on high-quality, diverse datasets that capture the full picture of branch placement. To achieve this, the platform consolidates information from trusted sources such as Google Maps Places API, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW), the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), manual research, and competitor banks (BPI, BDO, Metrobank, Landbank, and UnionBank). These datasets provide a balanced view of branch locations, demographics, economic activity, remittance flows, and financial products, forming the evidence-based foundation for the AI agent’s intelligent recommendations.
</p>

<h3> 🗺️ Data Sources </h3>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j1NYozv.png" alt="PinPoint Data Sources" width="100%"/>
</p>

### 📍 Branch Location Data  
- **Source:** Google Maps Places API  
- **Process:** Raw branch data is gathered from the API, then manually cleaned to remove duplicates and closed locations.  
- **Purpose:** Establishes a reliable foundation for geospatial analysis, enabling accurate branch mapping and location-based insights across Luzon.  

### 👥 Demographic Data  
- **Source:** Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)  
- **Coverage:** Population distribution, household characteristics, age groups, education, and other key demographic indicators at the region and province level.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures branch placement aligns with real community profiles, highlighting areas with dense populations or specific demographic needs.  

### 💼 Economic Data  
- **Source:** Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), Department of Migrant Workers (DMW)  
- **Focus:** Small and medium enterprise (SME) activity, business density, household income levels, and overseas Filipino worker (OFW) deployment data by region and province.  
- **Purpose:** Provides insight into economic vitality and growth potential, identifying regions with strong or emerging financial activity and OFW-driven remittance economies.  

### 🌍 OFW Remittance Data  
- **Source:** Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)  
- **Focus:** Remittance inflows and outflows, categorized by origin and destination, including provincial and regional breakdowns where available.  
- **Purpose:** Helps pinpoint areas with significant remittance-driven economies, guiding branch placement strategies in regions heavily supported by OFW families.  

### 🏙️ Wealth & Lifestyle Indicators  
- **Source:** Manual Research (Google, verified online sources)  
- **Coverage:** High-value establishments such as condominiums, casinos, international schools, malls, hotels, and luxury car showrooms.  
- **Purpose:** Serves as a proxy for regional wealth and purchasing power, highlighting prime areas with affluent communities and high economic activity.  

### 🏦 Bank Product & Competitor Data  
- **Source:** BPI, BDO, Metrobank, Landbank, and UnionBank  
- **Coverage:** Bank products, lending rates, deposit offers, promotions, and digital banking services. 
- **Purpose:** Enables competitive analysis of financial products, ensuring recommendations factor in both customer needs and competitor positioning.

### 📊 MSME Data  
- **Source:** Department of Trade and Industries (DTI)  
- **Process:** Data on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is collected from DTI records, cleaned to remove duplicates and inconsistencies, and aggregated by region, city, and sector.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a detailed overview of MSME distribution and sectoral composition, enabling targeted economic analysis, local business support, and strategic planning for regional development.

<!-- Data Acquisition and Storage Architecture -->
<h3> 🧩 Data Acquisition </h3> 

### Google Maps API - Branch Location
Branch location data was collected using the **Google Maps Places API**. To ensure comprehensive coverage, all cities and municipalities in Luzon were iterated, and **keyword filters** were applied to capture branches of the following banks: **BPI, BDO, Metrobank, UnionBank, and LandBank**. For each branch, the following information was retrieved:  

- **Branch name**  
- **City and province**  
- **Address**  
- **Type of establishment** (e.g., bank or ATM)  
- **Operational status**  
- **Star rating and number of ratings**  
- **Place ID**  

Because the **Google Maps Details API** does not filter for the most recent reviews, **BPI branch reviews were additionally web-scraped** to capture recent feedback. After collecting the data, Excel’s `VLOOKUP` function was used to assign **regions** to provinces for banks that did not provide region information. The same keyword-based approach was applied in reverse for other financial institutions to avoid duplicating previously collected data.

### Demographic and Economic Data
Demographic and economic data were primarily sourced from the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** website. This included indicators such as **GDP, GDP growth, poverty rate, annual LGU income, population distribution**, and other relevant statistics.

### OFW Data
Data related to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) were collected from official sources. The **Department of Migrant Workers** provided information on the number and distribution of OFWs, while **OFW remittance data** was obtained from the **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)**.

### Wealth Indicators
Wealth indicators were gathered using multiple approaches. The **Google Maps API** was used to locate condos, casinos, and hotels. International schools, major malls, and retail hubs were identified through **manual research**, while car showroom locations were obtained from the **Philkotse website**.

### Bank Product Data
Manual research was conducted on the official websites of **BPI, BDO, Metrobank, LandBank, and UnionBank** to collect data on their financial products, ensuring comprehensive coverage of offerings such as loans, deposits, and credit services.

### MSME Data  
The official website of the **Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)** was used to download MSME datasets in Excel format, providing a comprehensive overview of registered micro, small, and medium enterprises across the Philippines.
